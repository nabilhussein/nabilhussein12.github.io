		<h3>How to stay focused and motivated working from home</h3>
       <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, you can work from home <br> more often and recognize that staying at home as often as possible helps to<br> protect  you and others from the spread of the coronavirus. Nevertheless, <br>you can have days when it is difficult to remain motivated to work remotely or just <br>to spend too many hours of your day at home.</p>
        <p>“Regardless of whether you are going into work or telecommuting, adhering to the stay- at-home orders can be difficult,” says Dr. Elizabeth Brackin, a psychologist at Scripps Health.</p>



<p>“Whether it be the feeling of loss due to closures of restaurants and gyms, or parks and beaches, or the ‘new norm’ of going to the grocery store while standing in line wearing a mask, everyone is experiencing some degree of discomfort,” Brackin explains.</p>



<p>“Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to stay focused and motivated and feel productive, which are all good for your mental health,” she says.</p>
